Now is the autodidact's golden age. The Internet puts a wealth of near-instant knowledge at our fingertips, and the state-of-the-art of yesteryear is now affordable for lone individuals.

For less than â‚¬100, you can join the quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical current passing through neurons. This allows for measuring brain activity as it unfolds.

For most of human history, our only way of communicating with the outside world was with muscle movements. In the past century, this has changed. With EEG, paralyzed people are [communicating with the world around them](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/496019), and even [walking around in it](http://neurogadget.com/2013/03/13/mindwalker-exoskeleton-uses-eeg-cap-to-help-disabled-people-walk-again/7532).

Many of the cognitive algorithms our brains use are not be able to be perceived consciously. [Using EEG (and other technologies), we can watch our brains at work](http://lesswrong.com/lw/j2p/research_on_unconscious_visual_processing/). Reverse engineering is the only way we are going to obtain the blueprints of the mind, and EEG just might be the best gross level analysis tool at our disposal.
